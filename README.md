# EFN
This is a new cross-platform and open-source programming language built using Python. It is a Python library, but I wanna build an interpreter for it too! To install, type: py -m pip install EFN X.X.zip (replace X.X with the actual version of EFN) or py -m pip install EFN (latest) or py -m pip install EFN==4.1 (example).

# Why EFN?
EFN offers a readable syntax and good performance. EFN is really fast. Newer EFN versions also have AI and bot features. You should have a Python interpreter for it, but if EFN will have a custom interpreter, you don't need one.
