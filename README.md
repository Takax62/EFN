# EFN
This is a new cross-platform and open-source programming language built using Python. It is a Python library, but I wanna build an interpreter for it too! To install, type: py -m pip install EFNX.X.zip (replace X.X with the actual version of EFN).

# Why EFN?
EFN offers a readable, interpreter and good performance. EFN is fast when interpretered, but a bit slower when compiled. Newer EFN versions also have AI and bot features.
